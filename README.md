## Project Title
Blockchain-based Digital Rights Management

## Project Description
This project provides a decentralized solution for managing and enforcing digital rights for content creators. By leveraging blockchain technology, this system ensures transparent, secure, and immutable licensing, usage rights, and royalty payments for digital content. Smart contracts automate the process, ensuring fair compensation and protection of intellectual property for creators.

The vision of the Blockchain-based Digital Rights Management system is to empower content creators with control over their work while ensuring transparency and trust in the distribution and usage of digital content. By decentralizing the management of digital rights, we aim to eliminate intermediaries, reduce disputes, and guarantee automatic and fair compensation for creators based on pre-defined smart contract conditions.
